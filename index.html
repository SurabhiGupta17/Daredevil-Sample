        <h2>The Devil of Hell's Kitchen</h2>
        <p>The Daredevil is vicious and merciless towards criminals. 
        Although he refuses to kill, he is not afraid to break bones or torture his targets to get what he is after, 
        even if his targets are not criminals themselves. Due to his extremely violent nature as a vigilante, he 
        realizes that he has the potential to become the very thing he hates, and takes care to never cross that line. 
        <br><br>
        Originating from his exposure to a radioactive isotope, which rendered him blind, Murdock's heightened senses were actually latent "gifts" 
        that the isotope unlocked which gives him superhuman smell, tactile sense, hearing, taste, balance and radar sense.</p>

        <h2>The Man Under The Mask</h2>
        <p>Matthew Murdock possesses a strong sense of morality and justice, which he carries with him in his 
            work as a lawyer and a vigilante. While professional, Matt is not without a sense of humor, and is 
            very easygoing with his friends. Quips about his blindness don't bother him, and he even frequently
             jokes about it himself. 
             <br><br>
             Despite this, when under stress, Matt pushes the people around him away, 
             attempting to take all responsibility upon himself to fix Hell's Kitchen. Although he tries to be 
             a pillar of strength and support for the people around him, Matt can only take so much pressure before he breaks down.
             <br><br> 
             He also struggles with his internal feelings of anger, causing some (Foggy, Father Lantom, and even Matt himself)
               to question whether he fights for the city or simply "wants an excuse to punch someone."</p>

                were banished from the city and have since lived
                 on in the shadows for centuries, promoting their goal through wars, crime and influence on powerful people.
                <br><br>When the Hand came 
                 to New York City, the branch lieutenant <a href=" https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Nobu_Yoshioka" target="_blank" title="Nobu Yoshioka : Wiki">Nobu Yoshioka</a>

                 However, his plan was interrupted by the vigilante Daredevil, and eventually, they had to stop their operation after Yoshioka's death.</p>

                Having formed alliances with other criminal enterprises, Fisk then used the aftermath of the Battle of New York to gain power in the city, and 
                attempting to rebuild Hell's Kitchen by destroying and gentrifying it. 
                <br><br>
                His criminal activities brought him into a conflict with the 
                vigilante Daredevil, as well as some of his partners who betrayed him, and he was arrested after his actions were leaked to the FBI.</p>
